Welcome! These pages aim to provide all the information you need to master Ractive.

If you see something wrong, out of date, or missing from this documentation, please [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ractivejs/v0.x/issues) or - even better - submit a pull request. Your fellow Ractive users will thank you!

A good way to get up and running is with the [60 second setup](http://ractive.js.org/60-second-setup). After that, working your way through the [interactive tutorials](http://learn.ractive.js.org) will familiarise you with the various ways you can use Ractive.

If you get stuck at any point, visit the {{{createLink 'Get support'}}} page to find help.
